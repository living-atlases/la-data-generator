## Introduction

*Work in progress*

Many times we need some LA configurations, those generated by [ala-install](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ala-install/) typically in `/data` when using `ansible` to deploy a LA portal.

These configurations are useful for instance:
- To setup a [LA Development environment](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation/wiki/LA-Development-Guide#development-configuration).
- On docker LA deployments that don't use `ala-install`.

More than these configurations, it's also important to have a correct directory hierarchy, users/groups and permissions of this `/data` directory and descendants.

So many times people ask in our slack channel for these configurations, or ask for the permissions of some of these directories.

This helper generate this `/data` for you, using `docker` + `ala-install` + some-inventories and some basic steps.

## Prerequisites

### This repo

Clone or download this repository and follow these steps from there.

### Some inventories

You will need some LA generated `ansible` inventories, use the [command line](https://github.com/living-atlases/generator-living-atlas/) or the web interface: [https://generator.l-a.site](https://generator.l-a.site).

Setup a `LA_INV` enviroment shell variable pointing to the directory of these inventories:

```bash
export LA_INV=/home/myuser/the/directory/where/I/unziped/the/inventories
```

### Some `data` directory 

If you need some development environment, create a `/data` owner by you.

```bash
sudo mkdir /data
sudo chown youruser:youruser /data
export DATA_DIR=/data/
```

or if you don't need it for a develoment environment, you can create a data directory in any other location, for instance here:

```bash
sudo mkdir $PWD/data
export DATA_DIR=$PWD/data/
```

We'll use this `DATA_DIR` as a volume in the docker image.

### docker

As we mentioned above, we use `docker` to run `ansible` inside a container and generate that LA `/data` for you. 

So you need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) in the computer you are using.

### Optionally the `ala-install` repository

You can provide an `ala-install` cloned repository as a docker volume, or if not, we'll use a stable version for you.

Let's setup this in a varible also:

```bash
export ALA_INSTALL=/home/myuser/ala-install-location/
```

## Build

Now you can build this image:

```bash
docker build . -t la-data-config
```
## Or directly push

TODO publish to docker hub

## Run

### Run the image with stable `ala-install` 

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $DATA_DIR:/data  -v $LA_INV:/ansible/la-inventories -P -d --name la-data-config la-data-config:latest 
```
 
### Run the image with some `ala-install` volume

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $DATA_DIR:/data -v $LA_INV:/ansible/la-inventories -v $ALA_INSTALL:/ansible/ala-install -P -d --name la-data-config la-data-config:latest 
```

### Setup ssh in the container

```bash
docker exec -i -t la-data-config bash -c "cat /ansible/la-inventories/dot-ssh-config  | sed 's/1.2.3.X/127.0.0.1/g' | sed 's/IdentityFile/#IdentityFile/g' > /root/.ssh/config.d/la"
```

### Finally, generate `/data`

```bash
docker exec -i -t la-data-config bash -c 'cd /ansible/la-inventories; ./ansiblew --alainstall=/ansible/ala-install all --tags=properties --skip=restart,image-stored-procedures --nodryrun'
```

and see the `uid`/`gid` of each user with:

```bash
docker exec -i -t la-data-config bash -c 'id tomcat7; id solr; id image-service; id postgres'
```

## Re-run

You can edit your inventories to fit better to your needs, [update the inventories](https://github.com/living-atlases/generator-living-atlas#rerunning-the-generator), and rerun the previous `ansiblew` docker exec command.
